        <h2>Welcome to the gameplay of among us</h2>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p> The crewmates' goal is to complete tasks around the ship and identify the impostors among them, while the impostors aim to sabotage the ship and eliminate crewmates without being caught. </p>
        <h3>Tasks:</h3>
        <p> Crewmates have a list of tasks to complete around the ship, such as fixing wires, downloading data, and emptying garbage. Completing tasks contributes to the overall progress of the crew and increases the chances of winning.    
        <h3>Meetings:</h3>
        <p> If a player discovers a dead body or suspects someone of being an impostor, they can call an emergency meeting or report the body. During meetings, players discuss suspicions, alibis, and evidence to vote out the suspected impostor(s).</p>
        <h3>Voting:</h3>
        <p> After discussion, players vote on who they believe is the impostor. The player with the most votes is ejected from the ship. If all impostors are eliminated or if the crew completes all tasks, the crewmates win. If the number of impostors equals the number of crewmates or if critical sabotage goes unresolved, the impostors win.</p>
        <h3>Sabotage:</h3>
        <p> Impostors can sabotage various systems on the ship, such as causing reactor meltdowns or cutting off oxygen supply. Crewmates must quickly respond to and fix these sabotages to prevent losing the game.</p>
        <h3>Impostor Abilities:</h3>
        <p> Impostors have special abilities, such as the ability to vent through the ship to move quickly or to kill crewmates in secret. They must use these abilities strategically to sow chaos and eliminate crewmates without being detected.</p>    </p>
